3. write a pseudocode to reverse the digits of a number

enter a input from user as num

initialize rev to 0.

iterate a while loop with a condition num>0.

inside while loop divide num by 10 store it in rem variable.

store (rev*0)+rem variable in rev.

then store a num//10 in num.

end a hile loop

print rev
