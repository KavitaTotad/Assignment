2. write an algorithem to determine whether a number is a prime number or not

step 1: define recursive function that accepts an integer num

step 2: initialize the number n to 0

step 3: if a num is equal to 0 or 1 then return false.

step 4: iterative for loop from 2 to num/2

step 5 : if num is divisible by iterator then increment n

step 5: if n=0 then print number is prime. or else number is not prime
